- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fath3ad,
- 👀 I’m interested in re-learning programming so I can create cool tools to help me be more productive. It's been over 20 years since I did any real programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Visual Studio Code IDE, C#.Net, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular and MongoDB.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at this stage - hopefully soon, when I have learned some basic skills.
